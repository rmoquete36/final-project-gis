 <h2>About this Project</h2>
 This project is in response to the final assignment of an Interactive Web Mapping course at NYU.
 
 This map reflects aggregate counts of shooting incidents in New York City between 2015 and 2020, by precinct. I further provide socioeconomic census data for all NTAs in the City.
